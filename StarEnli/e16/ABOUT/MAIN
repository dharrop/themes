This is the StarEnli-DR16 theme for Enlightenment.  It is based on the
StarEnli-0.13 theme for Enlightenment and has been fixed up to meet the
latest Enlightenment standards (Development Release 0.16).

The original artwork was done by Canin (http://www.canin.tel.debica.pl/)
and subsequent artwork, cleaning up, configuration files and maintenance
are done by flea (http://www.flea.org/).
