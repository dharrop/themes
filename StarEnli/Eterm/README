Eterm 0.9.2 StarEnli Theme
--------------------------

This theme was designed to go with the StarEnli theme for Enlightenment.
Find the theme at http://www.flea.org/starenli/

Like all other flea.org releases, this theme is released under the terms of
the GNU General Public Licence, obtainable at
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html. 

Installation
------------

1. In ~/.Eterm/themes/ or /usr/share/Eterm/themes/ (or wherever else you
store your Eterm themes) run the following command:

        tar zxvf StarEnli-Eterm-theme.tar.gz

2. To run Eterms with this theme run the following command:

        Eterm -t StarEnli

Custom Configuration
--------------------

The default theme has the same font and window size settings as the
BrushedMetal Eterm theme.

To set your personal requirements put a file called user.cfg in
~/.Eterm/themes/StarEnli/ with settings as required.  See any
theme.cfg file to view the many settings can be changed.

Mine looks like this, the main effect of which is to give me smaller
windows and a funkier font (Raster's nexus font). The commented section
allows me to control whether I want to show a background image or not.
