Thanks for giving this theme a spin, I hope you enjoy it :)

 Bonus Bits
 /* When I get theme finished anyway ;) */
   CNTerm: Eterm theme (not just an automode theme, changed colours to balance
   with the Etheme).

   Install this by changing dir into ~/.Eterm/themes type cp -r <path to
   cn_eterm>. Then simply type Eterm -t cn_eterm

 GKrellm Theme

   cn_gkrellm: The gkrellm match

   Install this by changing into ~/.gkrellm/themes and typing cp -r
   <path to cn_gkrellm>. It should now be available in you gkrellm theme
   selector.

The inspiration for this one was Gridlocks V theme for sawfish. I liked it,
I liked it a lot! But, I wanted something more E! so I merged parts of the V
idea with DAE and voila (origional title :/) (DAE_V2) Chromium Noise.

This is far from complete but, is way more useable than the origional (DAE)!
besides that the title is way cooler ;)

All the graphics have been hand rendered using the Gimp's powerful features,
mainly the airbrush. (not just gradients this time). These images have been
"hand painted" for a better feel. D.A.E. was just a bunch of gradients but,
you knew that allready ;)

I'm hoping to keep this one in development through E17 failing that I'll just
start some more themes and never finish them when E17 comes out.

P.S. i guess you'll be wondering where the chrome is? errrr, pretend like it's
     dirty or something ;)
