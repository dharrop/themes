  About
  <br>
  <font face=vixar/17 color=#009ec6>
  The theme that D.A.E. should have been!
    <p align=0%>
    <font face=vixar/14 color=#009ec6>
    The inspiration for this one was Gridlocks V theme for sawfish. I liked it,
    I liked it a lot! But, I wanted something more E! so I merged parts of the V
    idea with DAE and voila (DAE_V2) 
    <p align=75%>
    ...Chromium Noise.
    <p>
    This is far from complete but, is way more useable than the origional (DAE)!
    besides that, the title is way cooler.
    <p>
    All the graphics have been hand rendered using the Gimp's powerful features,
    mainly the airbrush. (not just gradients this time). These images have been
    "hand painted" for a better feel. D.A.E. was just a bunch of gradients but,
    you knew that allready.
    <p>
    I'm hoping to keep this one in development through E17 failing that I'll
    just start some more themes and never finish them when E17 comes out.
    <p>
    P.S. i guess you'll be wondering where the chrome is? errrr, pretend like
    it's dirty or something.

    Many thanks to Gridlock for alowing me to port V to Enlightenment. It was
    during the porting experiments that this theme came up.
    <p>
    Thanks to Kyle for beta testing and a few bits I missed (IMAGE WINDOW close
    button).
    <p>
    Thanks to AceMC03 for trying to convince me DAE doesn't suck and for
    getting me to create the larger widget set.

    I'm basically lost in the mid 80's still listening to S.I.D. chip tunes
    somewhere around 85 I think.

    I used to be a fanatical Amigan until 8 bit quality audio didn't cut it
    anymore but I still have a special fondness of the amiga interface & style.
    Been using Linux since my 
    amiga died of old age (and a screwdriver to the hard drive).

    In my spare time I write music and make enlightenment themes.
