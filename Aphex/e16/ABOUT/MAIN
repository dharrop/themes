This is the APHEX enlightenment theme.  It is designed to work best on debian systems running at 1600x1200.  It should perform adequately on other systems.

Almost all of the artwork in this theme is original, but a variety of bits and pieces were created by altering pre-existing images.  Buttons come courtesy of Tigert, and backgrounds were altered from Propaganda backgrounds (originally created by Bowie J. Poag).
