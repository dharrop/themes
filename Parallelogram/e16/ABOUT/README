I like to use this in conjucntion the ShinyMetal GTK theme (which is where
the window buttons come from).  I am not a Trekkie; I just love the font.

Backgrounds left out to keep the theme small.  I have some underwater photos
and texture backgrounds at http://www.LinuxGeek.com/.  I also highly
recommend the gallery at http://www.digitalblasphemy.com/.
