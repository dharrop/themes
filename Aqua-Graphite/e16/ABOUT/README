XaquaX - for (THE MOST CURRENT VERSION OF) enlightenment 0.16
----------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings,

If you like this theme, please send me a nice warm email to encourge me to
keep up the work.  Most of the configuration files were based on BlueSteel
theme.  Images were collected or created from Mac OSX screen shot on Apple
website.  Thanks to all the creative minds that originally designed Aqua
on Mac OSX, and Rasterman and Mandrake who created Enlightenment, and all
the people who put bits of their life into Linux.  I uses the
default epplet theme from BrushMetal-Tigert because I guess there are
parts of the default epplets theme which reflects well on the Quick time
player on the MacOSX screen shot.  I hope you like it.

regards,
aada aka Eric Yang
