Thanks for using Circuit E, the theme that thinks diffrently.
This theme is created by Christian Ullrich using nothing but
The Gimp and the magic source from Brushed Metal Tigert.
Not everything is originaly made by me - but who's E theme can
say that ;)   
<br>
This theme is going to be following the cvs version of E and not the
stable version (DR0.16.2)
<br>
<br>
Special thanks to Christoph Thielecke for his great work on Linux!
And also Kathleen for her critical meanings.
