Time to Re-theme Everything

Thanks for using Small E(which is based on Absolute E, the theme that thinks diffrently.
This theme was modified/created by Hisham Mardam Bey  using nothing but
The Gimp.  Everything is originaly made by me - Propably the only
Etheme that can say that ;)
<br>
This theme is going to be following the cvs version of E and not the
stable version (DR0.15.4)(Absolute E)
