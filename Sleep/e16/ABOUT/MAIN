Welcome to the Sleep Enlightenment theme.

This theme is hopefully kept up to date with the latest version of Enlightenment,
so please drop me a line if you are experiencing problems with it running on your
system.

- Added Eterm automode support. There are a few things you might need to know
before you can use it though:
<p>
1.  You need Eterm 0.9. The easiest way of running with automode is to use the auto theme. (As in
"Eterm -t auto").
<p>
2.  The auto theme in the current Eterm snapshot has a few issues, including not
including the it's own menu file, having bold font for the font menu but none of
the others and having black menu text. These can all be fairly easily fixed by a
bit of editing in the appropriate theme files.
