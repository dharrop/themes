This is the minEguE2 theme. It is based on the QN-X11 Sawfish theme which is based on some QNX borders. This is a rough draft using many pieces of my minEguE theme. That theme was based on earlier QNX screenshots from last summer. Thanks to Aubin Paul (aubin@narnia.webhosting.com) for suggesting I give this theme a try. and of course Rowan Kerr (rowan2stasis.org) for making the QN-X11 theme.
<P>
Send any suggestions, etc. to me. I'm curious what you think.
