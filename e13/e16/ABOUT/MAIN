This theme is a port of the E13 default theme to E0.16. It's a bit of a crazy theme so don't whine about it being slow ;-)
<P>
I have a special place in my heart for this theme--it was screenshots of this theme that most turned me onto Linux. I hope you enjoy it.

Send any suggestions, etc. to me. I'm curious what you think.
