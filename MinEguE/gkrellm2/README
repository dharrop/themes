I got a MinEguE gkrellmm-skin from a friend some days ago but wasn't totally satisfyed with anything...
So i cleaned it up for my own needs, which include gkrellmms theme and special theming for the volume-plugin...

The images for gkrellmms is taken from the MinEguE xmms skin, so is also the green color which i like...
I also took the sliders and krell thingys (the yellow things :) from John Fregeau's minegue-beta theme...
