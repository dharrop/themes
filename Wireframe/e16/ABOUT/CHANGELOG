Some .PNGs don't load so well in Gimp etc.  Converted everything to
.XPM.  Thanks to Masaaki Kimbara for pointing this out.

Hmm, not quite a good start, is it?  This change, a mere eighteen hours
after the first release, affects the borders FULL_FIXED and
FULL_FIXED_SIDE.  If you look closely (preferably at an unfocused
window), you'll see the sides of the titlebar going past the window.
Sure, it's only one or two pixels, but it's just not _right_!  Anyway,
I've fixed it.  Apologies if anyone downloaded this before the
correction...

I've finally decided to release this theme.  It should appear two or
three days after I've written this...  This is the first release, and
as such may contain a bug or two.  Feel free to mail me about them; see
the README for my email address.  This address is likely to change
sometime in the next year or two, if it stays stable I'll tell you.  In
the meantime, if your mail is bounced back, don't send another.
