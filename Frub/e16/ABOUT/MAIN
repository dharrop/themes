Frub is a clean + simple theme. Initially I designed it to look like MacOS, then I decided it should look more like AmigaOS, but it has evolved into something which is kinda a cross between them both. Graphically, this theme is rather lapse, so it would be good for running KDE/GNOME/EFM with, not that I do. Look for frequent updates, as I am always trying new things both with Layout & Design.</p>

NB: As most about dialogs are boring, I decided to make mine a bit different. The picture is of a VALinux employee called Maven, which I found in between crufty and seedy pictures of Mandrake & Raster :). I thought it was a nice pic and wanted to use it somewhere in the theme. Hope I have not offended anyone by using it!</p>
