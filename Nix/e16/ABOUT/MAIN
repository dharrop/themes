	Ok. This theme is somewhat thicker than most. It all began as an early
	release of hoax's BlueHeart theme that didn't have a fully working slideout.
	So I started editing the .cfg files. Then I found an equally blue theme on
	Litestep.net that kicked ass, and I figured hell, enough LS themes are
	ports of E themes....why not port a worthy LS theme to Enlightenment? So
	this is basically nIxStep blue, a theme by "nIx" aka Lee Nichols, who can be
	contacted at lnichols@netcomuk.co.uk  or  e.s.c@netcomuk.co.uk <br>
	- all done with permission of course ;)
<br>

<p align=50%>
	I've heard of plots and schemes towards _getting_rid(plea) of the desktop buttons.
	WHY!? nIx is heavilly based on buttons and can not exist without them! Besides, isn't 
	Enlightenment all about choices and possibilities?

	The main audio wavs are clips from Clive Barker's Lord of Illusions, 
	a cool movie with an even cooler villan who happens to be named "nIx".

Windows sucks. <br> 
We all know it. <br>
We are the smart ones.<br> 
We chose Linux; <br>
<br>
<br>
And thus we were Enlightened...

	To customize this theme to suit your needs you no longer need to make your own pixmaps; all you have to do is edit 3 	files; actionclasses.cfg, buttons.cfg, and slideouts.cfg. Just add a new actionclass for what you want executed, add in a 	new button in the appropriate location in buttons.cfg, using a new label and don't forget to point it to your new 	actionclass. Then add the button name in slideouts.cfg in the posisition you want.
<br>      
You're going to need an example, you say? Very well...pay attention.

	This is a sufficient actionclass for a new button; <br>	
	For cleanliness you should put it in "wharf/wharf_actions.cfg"
	instead of just actionclasses.cfg
<br>

	Where "NAME" is the new name for your ACLASS, <br>
	"TOOLTIP TEXT" is obviously what is displayed for the tooltip, <br>
	And "ACTION A EXEC" executes the given command. Easy, huh? <br>

	Then define the new item in "wharf/wharf_buttons.cfg" ; <br>

<br>

	Where "NAME" is the new name for your BUTTON; <br>
	"ACLASS" should correspond to your new actionclass, <br>
	And "LABEL" is the text that will be on the button itself.

<br>

	And then just add the new button in whatever slideout you desire;<br>
	(This can go in plain old slideouts.cfg)
<br>
<br>	
<br>
<img src=slide.png x=100 y=70>

<br>
<br>

<p align=50%>
	  There. That's it. Easy to configure, and no more mis-matched pixmap fonts!
	  As you can see, you just place the new BUTTON in it's respective posiistion
	  in the slideout.<br>
<br>
	  That's it. Restart Enlightenment and the changes should take effect.

	NO!!
<font face=avgardm/11 color=#FFFFFF>
<br>
<p align=50%>
<br>

	I don't see why desktop buttons are all of a sudden considered
	lame and undesireable. Without them Enlightenment themes will be 
	confined to "just borders." I understand that with a theme like nIx it 
	may be difficult for a newbie to realize that to edit the files they 
	must untar the theme; and then  have deal with finding the right file
	to edit, but hey, this is Linux here. If they want ease of configuration they should just stick with that famous "start" button!
<br>
<br>
	As long as buttons are not completely removed, I'll be happy, and
	nIx will survive.
