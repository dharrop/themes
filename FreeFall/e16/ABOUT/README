Time for a README
-----------------

You will recognize that the strukture of this theme is different from the
one recommended in the default theme BrushedMetal-Tigert. I prefer this one, 
because it seems more usefull to me and until it has no influenze to 
functionality I won't change this.

This morning I received an e-mail from Maher Awamy <muhri@muhri.net>, 
who sent me a tarball with the automode stuff for Eterm from CVS, which I 
never used before. I felt to inlcude this in cyrus and so: Cyrus has Eterm 
Automode Support now. Thanks!!!

xmms skin going with cyrus.
