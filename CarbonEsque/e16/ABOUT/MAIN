<p>So... Here we are again!
<p>No matter how many times I try to use a different WM/DE I always come back to e16 (DR16 for those of you who've been using e long enough to remember). It's true what they say, the grass is never greener and regardless of how much bloat/additional features are added nothing compares! Enlightenment is that girlfriend you had but dumped for someone with bigger/better (insert preference here) and no matter how much you're into this new love there are too many things you miss.
<p>Say it with me
<p>Enlightenment! Because everything else is just pants!
<p>The EDOX viewer is looking naff today thanks to a lack of bitmap font love. There's no way I wanted to sully this theme with ttf anything. All (default) fonts in this theme are either created or modded by me and they are bitmap fonts, I'm feeling old school! Yes, old school, even to the point of adding a silly uppercase e to the name of the theme (:
<p>CarbonEsque baby! Learn to love it!
<p>All other information is contained in the README have a look at that... do it now!
