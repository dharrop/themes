SKIN NOTES:
No playlist as of now - design limitations within winamp and xmms, to my
knowledge, don't allow stretching a  texture instead of tiling, so it would
look like crap anyway.
Skin designed to be used with the Viridis Enlightenment theme by the
same author.
Visit e.themes.org to download Viridis for E.

DESIGN NOTES:
This skin was designed using my Marble xmms skin as a template, which was, in
turn, created from JazzMidi & Alf's Brushed Metal skin.
