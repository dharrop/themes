This theme mac3D was created by Mark J Eaton aka HeTTaR ( hettar@uq.net.au )

   The theme is designed to extensively use Colormodifiers to make it easy
for users to change the colours to suit their preferences. The theme is
intended to be a clean and efficient environment in which to work whilst 
also being pleasing to the eye (this is of course subjective and I am 
open to suggestions).

   To use this theme you will really require Gnome. both to use the 
root menus effectively and also becuse I haven't filled the desktop 
with buttons prefering to have space in which to put applications.

   You are free to use this theme yourself. You are free to give this
theme to other people. You are free to include this theme on CD's or
pretty much where ever you want to. All I ask is that this file and 
the headers in the *.cfg files remain in place, you don't claim credit
for my work and that you tell me about it so that I can feel good ;o).
