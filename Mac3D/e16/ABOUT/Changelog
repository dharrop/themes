   Ok this is the first entry in the Changelog =)
   Updated mac3D to meet the new theme specs as
   defined by Raster. this includes:
      - Removing keybindings.cfg so that the default ones are used.
      - Theme renamed to mac3D.etheme
      - Changed control.cfg to only change the minimum number of things.
           namely the width of the dragbar.

   Added the image class coords so that the coords are shown in the corner
   when moving widows around etc.
   
17/02/1999
   Added the image classes and textclasess DIALOG and DIALOG_BUTTON to the 
   init.cfg file so that the theme doesn't segfault with the new cvs 
   version of E15.

   Some fairly major changes to the look of various bits of the theme.
   I wasn't happy with a few bits, or perhaps I was just bored of them.
   Changed the buttons to a much preferable configureation too.
