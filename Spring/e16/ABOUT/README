--- ABOUT SPRING THEME ---

Spring theme is based on Winter theme originally made by Rephorm,
without his work Spring would probably never exist.


Spring was designed for Enlightenment 0.16.x (better 0.16.7+)
It was essentialy inspired and made to pursue the concept of
seasons introduced by Winter, with a nice green-fashioned visual 
style dedicated to the beauty of spring.
 
Also it have few enhancements and minors bugfixes (like biger
fonts more confortable for high-resolution screen, better pager,
alternate color background for every virtual desktops, fixed
display of percentage progress at startup, etc) you'll certainly
appreciate when using Spring theme.

Quick FAQ


- How to install Spring E16 theme ?

First uncompress the tar.gz theme file with the tar -xzvf command,
after that, simply put the Spring directory obtained in your home
directory under ~/.enlightenment/themes


- The theme doesn't work for me, what can I do ?

Verify your version of Enlightenment : if you use an older version
(eg. before 0.16.5) the theme will probably not work correctly. So
if you're in this case update your Enlightenement version if you
want use Spring.


- Can I use this theme under E17 ?

A quick answer : no. E17 theme engine is not the same as E16 and
work with a different theme format. For this reason all E16 themes
including Spring will NOT work with E17.


- Do you plane to port this theme under E17 ?

Hum that seems to be a good idea in the future ;-) I probably did
a port of Spring soon after official release of E17, because it
still misses a lot of features in his actual state of development.
Currently I'm focused on the realisation of two other seasonal
fashioned themes (Summer and Autumn) for the last fans of E16 :-)
