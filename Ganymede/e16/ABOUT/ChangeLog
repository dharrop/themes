                    -~= ChangeLog =~-


		    	   o.5

:) 12/27/99 Changed scrollbars in the E and Eterm theme
	    so that they match the GTK theme's. Finally
	    stepped up version number.

		    	   o.4

:) 12/12/99 Made the windowmatch for rotated borders
	    a little greedier (150 pixels now), also
	    fixed a bug in the epplet togglebutton.
	
:) 11/21/99 Minor changes to the gkrellm theme, fixed
	    iconbox bg (the bg wouldn't return once set
	    to transparency ...), added copyright headers.

:) 10/31/99 Fixed a Happy Halloween Bug -- the ARROW_UP
	    and ARROW_DOWN epplet pixmaps were swapped ...
	
:) 10/27/99 Changed backgrounds for dialogs, menus and
	    documentation.
	
:) 10/19/99 Mhm .. maybe this should be o.5. Anyway,
	    added a whole bunch of colormoded images,
	    added epplet support. Updated MAIN & README.
	    Added a script for automated installation
	    of buttons and pulldown menues. Oh, and
	    added a Makefile, just for convenience.
	
:) 10/8/99  Threw out everything related to colormods,
	    cleaned up menustyles.cfg, disabled buttons
	    by default, added a script for re-enabling
	    them, updated documentation.
	
:/ Why don't I have dates in here?
:) Added gkrellm theme.

			   o.3

	
:) Hopefully prepared everything for commiting to the
   CVS repository -- Yeeehaaa !!!
:) -- SIGH -- moved the whole thing to the new standard.
:) Added some missing imageclasses for desktop areas in
   the settings dialogs.
:) Changed the icon in the tooltips.
	
                           o.2

:) The Eterm theme is now based on Eterm CVS code. The
   scrollbar is on the left now (to be out of the way
   for the grabber in the bottom right of the windows)
:) The iconbox is now available.
:) Some tooltips now have the icon look.
:) Added borders and shortcuts for window groups. Try
   the middle button on the titlebar to see what I mean.
:) Lots of internal changes. The files grew too large,
   I use #includes now.  
:) Well, added a Changelog ;)
