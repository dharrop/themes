This is the BurgandE theme for Enlightenment. I believe it supports all of DR0 16.
I will continue to work on it and try to keep it functioning with newer versions
as they arise. If I am missing something please notify me.

I will be spending some time over the next littlewhile to try to clean it up.

I hope you like my theme. There is a matching gkrellm theme on http://www.muhri.net

In The future expect a licq theme. It is in the works.

Thanks, egggman
