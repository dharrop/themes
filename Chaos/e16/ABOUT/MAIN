e-chaos is a port for Enlightenment of the chaos blackbox theme<br>
by artwiz (http://artramp.org).<br><br>
Some graphics were taken from chaos for XMMS,<br>
by Omar Hussain (http://ohussain.cjb.net/).<br><br>
Some widgets, like arrows, scrollbars, check and radio buttons<br>
are taken from chaos-gtk by JP Bizet (http://jpb.freeyellow.com)<br>
which were taken from blueHeart-GTK by Chris Fofiu.<br><br>
Also, many ideas, fixes, suggestions, pieces of advice,<br>
general proddings, yadda, yadda,<br>
have come from JP, to whom I am eternally grateful.<br><br>
The theme goes well with his chaos-gtk theme<br>
and n0l0g1k's chaos for gkrellm (http://n0l0g1k.de.st).<br>
<br><br>
Thanks to everyone who in some way, helped form this.
