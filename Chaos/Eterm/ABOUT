This is e-chaos Eterm theme inspired by e-chaos Enlightenment theme.
All the images are taken from Enlightenment e-chaos thanks to
Jonathan Schwarz and all who helped to get those images. I just
copied all the necessary images and wrote up config file for which
I should thank Christian Kreibich who wrote Ganymede Theme.

Hope you like it.
