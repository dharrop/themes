    I know the whole glass effect is old, tried, tested and tired. I just wanted to make
    A theme out of it. I am not a big fan of the generic mac ports, so I figured I'd try
    something a little different.
    <p>
    <p>
    <p>
    This theme came about after a conversation between myself and everdark concerning the
    lack of killer n?x themes. I decided it was time to make a bit more effort. Blue Steel, 
    bluehEart & any darkalloy (Brass, Anomaly etc...) theme still hold up today, but there
    seems to be a lack of new themes that can compete on this level.
    <p>
    <p>
    <p>
    I am in NO WAY suggesting that this theme is great, I am also NOT saying this is the best
    theme to be made since 2001, I'm just hoping that you feel that this is another step
    in the right direction.

    I would like to thank all the friends that I have made at deviantart and all those great
    Skin designers that reside there. You guys have inspired me beyond my own expectations.
    By viewing the work of others, I have learned a great deal,
    <p align=50%>
    Thanks!
    <p>
    Extra special thanks go to Hippy (http://hippy.deviantart.com) for the glass tutorial,
    It may have been for paint shop, but it gave me pointers and taught me more about gimp ;) Also to Azundris for pointing out my error in the check /
radio buttons.
