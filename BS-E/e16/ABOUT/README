Ok then, so what can I say here ...

This theme was made by Visu in the week of the 19th of March 1999 when
I should really have been revising for exams, So the number of better
be high to make it worth my while if i fail :-)

It was great getting some comments, gave me the motiviation to carry
on working on it.

The graphics are all original as far as I can remember. The cows were
sketched, scanned, then edited in the GIMP.
