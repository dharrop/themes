Wow, someones' actually using this !<br>
This theme is still not quite finished. It could do with some better buttons, 
if anyone wants to make some :) Graphics created using The Gimp 
and Bryce 2. To get the backgrounds included with the theme you'll have to select them manually or remove your .enlightenment dir and restart with the theme<br>
The excellent font, Augie, is by Steven J. Lundeen. Details in augie.txt
