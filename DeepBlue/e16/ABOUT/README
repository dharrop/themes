Deep Blue etheme.

Thanks for using this theme , no really !

This is my first theme release, so its not quite as polished as it 
could be, but it works and it looks good, and thats all that matters :)

Feel free to do whatever you want with it, take bits from it, whatever.

Note : For anyone wondering why the sound isnt working...

As all of the sounds came from the default theme I decided to leave them
out the second time round as anyone who has enlightenment already has them, 
and anyone who hasn't ... well, why should they download it anyway ?

To get it working again you'll need to copy the sounds into the deep-blue/snd
directory and uncomment sound.cfg


If anyone wants to do some better buttons for the desktop slideout, feel
free then email them to me ! :-)

Visu..
