This is the Black theme for enlightenment.  I made this theme for my personal
use and made it available to the public.  I do not intened to implement every
feature that E supports unless I find it useful.  If you want add support for
something else please do.  I have no problems adding support if you figure out
how to do it.

I also do not intend to follow the "rules" layed out for E-themes.  I like
buttons that launch apps.  I accept that this does not make the theme as
flexable.  However as I do not use other themes it does not really matter to
me.
