OPENSTEP4.2 theme by Jesse Kaufman <kaufmjes@linuxfreak.com>, based on eStep_New
by Greg Mindrum <rael@one.net>.

This theme was created to give enlightenment a bit of the OPENSTEP4.2 look/feel.
It goes well w/ the GtkSTEP gtk+ theme and the NeXT-ish icons I will soon be
posting on my webpage <http://www.linuxfreak.com/~kaufmjes>.

Note:  I am NOT the original author of the theme.  I just revised eStep_New to
have a bit more of an OPENSTEP 4.2 look.  I also fixed a few "problems"
that annoyed me w/ the original one.
