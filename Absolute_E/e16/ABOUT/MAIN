Time to Re-theme Everything

Thanks for using Absolute E, the theme that thinks diffrently.
This theme is created by Hallvar Helleseth using nothing but
The Gimp.  Everything is originaly made by me - Propably the only
Etheme that can say that ;) Though alot of people have helped me
(too many to list here/can't remeber all of them either...) But
I give them a BIG thank you!
<br>
There is a GTK and WMaker version of this theme available at themes.org
An Absolute E xmms/winamp skin can be found at www.xmms.org
