SKIN NOTES:
Skin should be viewed with 24bit colors or higher.
A some what dark background is also recommended.

DISIGNER NOTES:
This skin was inspired by Hallvar's Enlightenment
Theme called "AbsoluteE" for Linux.
I liked the color combination and the out side
bead around the shell. So to make my desktop more
complete I decided to make a xmms skin to along
with the theme. I really had a lot of fun making
this skin, well that's why I make them - 
just for fun and to share them with you. =)

NOTE FOR ENLIGHTENMENT USERS:
You need to edit the pledit.txt file and
change the "NormalBG" to a darker pallet color
for the background color for the PlayList. It
looks a little light in enlightenment.
You can try:
NormalBG=#363d36
or someting else around that shade.

THINGS TO DO:
- Shorten up winshade modes to match the length

  problems with the transparency on the EQ
  winshade mode. xmms does not like it. =(
