  This MetalliquE theme is a try to give the Enlightenment desktop a fully
  metallic and industrial look. It is completely based on the excellent
  'Cyrus' theme by Markus Kniebes. Only most of the graphics have been
  changed (not the Epplets and Eterm ones, yet) using The Gimp (thanx to
  the gradient tool and the Gimpressionist filter).

  I am running Linux Slackware 7, and I have been using lots of window
  managers, ending my journey with Enlightenment, the most impressive of
  them all. I am not an artist, in fact, but I have already shared my time
  with many open projects.

  Don't hesitate to contact me, whatever you have to say.
