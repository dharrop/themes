-< MetalliquE >- theme for Enlightenment.

This theme is supposed to fit with the 0.16.x series of the
Enlightenment window manager. It is based on the excellent
[Cyrus] theme by Markus Kniebes. Only graphics have been changed,
and this theme would never have come out without his previous
work on [Cyrus].
All the graphics were made with The Gimp, and particularly
the gradient tool (!!!).

I hope you will enjoy this contribution to the growing world
of "open projects", in which Enlightenment takes a major
part. Long live Rasterman :o)

Thanx to James Ramsey, this package should unpack properly
now.
