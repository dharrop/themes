Eazel-E.port 
This is a port of the original Eazel sawfish theme using Green and g0ld
borders 
This was easier to ported cuz i already have port the Eazel-blue so i just had
to change the images :) 

Enjoy -- --- --

btw as at the Eazel-blue you need nexus font to have this one running porperly
too if you dont got em get them from the ttfonts dir
