"Java Steel"<br>

This is a near complete rewrite for the theme previously known as 'Metal' which was unfortunately plagued with misunderstood syntax and odd graphic choices.<br><br>
The new rendition is in tribute to all those at Sun Microsystems who have poured their heart and soul into the massive "Open Source" efforts preluding the Oracle acquisition.<br><br>
May you have the best future possible!<br><br>
