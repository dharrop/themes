This theme "alpha" was created by Mark J Eaton aka HeTTaR ( hettar@uq.net.au )

   This theme is designed to be a sleek useable theme with a smoky black 
colour. It is complemented by the alpha gtk theme which provides the complete 
alpha look.


   You are free to use this theme yourself. You are free to give this
theme to other people. You are free to include this theme on CD's or
pretty much where ever you want to. All I ask is that this file and 
the headers in the *.cfg files remain in place, you don't claim credit
for my work and that you tell me about it so that I can feel good ;o).
