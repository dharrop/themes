NewSTEP theme by Jesse Kaufman <kaufmjes@linuxfreak.com>, based on eStep_New
by Greg Mindrum <rael@one.net>.

This theme was created to give enlightenment a bit of the NeXTSTEP look/feel.
It goes well w/ the GtkSTEP gtk+ theme and the NeXT-ish icons I will soon be
posting on my webpage <http://www.linuxfreak.com/~kaufmjes>.

Note:  I am NOT the original author of the theme.  I just revised eStep_New to
have a bit more of a NeXT look.  I also fixed a few "problems" that annoyed me
w/ the original one.  Any sounds included w/ this theme are not neccessarily
mine, and as far as I know, they are public domain.  If any aren't, let me know
and they will be removed immediately.
