Thanks for using this theme. I can't take credit for all areas of this
theme, i used bits and pieces from BrushedMetal and hacked the cfg's from
CleanBig. All of the border gfx and the buttons are original. I created
this theme to look a bit like the textures seen in the pod-race scene from
episode one.
