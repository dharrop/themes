This is the nqBe (not quite Be) theme for Enlightenment DR16.  This
theme attempts to approximate as closely as possible the look and feel
of the BeOS.  Subsequent pages of the DOX file will explain how to
mimic other things that aren't possible directly in the theme.
<p>
The artwork and configuration were done by sellout
(http://technomadic.org/sellout/).  If you have any suggestions
(authenticity comes before convenience) please send them along to
sellout@technomadic.org.  Thanks.
