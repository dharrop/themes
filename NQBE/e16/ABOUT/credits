nqBe theme for Enlightenment DR16, by Greg Pfeil <pfeilgm@technomadic.org>

originally based on the BeOS theme for DR15, by Kevin Miller and Mike Bond

Their theme had a bit of the look of BeOS 4 (since they had only seen
screenshots).  nqBe takes it further by trying to get Enlightenment to act
as much like the Be interface as possible.

While I think I have cleverly (look at the splash screen) removed any
trademarks, be aware that . . .

The Be logo and some other "Be-like" items are registered trademarks of Be Inc.
