    Tribal Masks by Gedeon Maheux

    I had been wanting to create a set of icons based on primitive
    tribal art for some time. Since I've been lagging way behind in my
    OS X icon making skills, I decided to make this next release
    optimized for OS X. After gathering reference images from some great
    African and South Pacific websites, I set out to graphically
    translate what I had found. It took several attempts to find the
    right blend of line weight, color treatment and shading before I was
    happy with the result, but in the end (and after several round of
    tweaking) I was pleased with how they turned out.

    I've always enjoyed tribal masks, art, patterns and carvings ever
    since I can remember. I think it might have started when my parents
    and I visited Walt Disney World and stayed in the Polynesian Resort
    Hotel <http://home.cfl.rr.com/omniluxe/poly.htm>. I remember the
    sights, sounds, decorative artwork and motifs that adorned the
    hotel, and although it was an Americanized version of the subject, I
    was drawn to it.

    I hope you enjoy this small set of icons based on cultures and folk
    art from Tribes around the world. I had a great deal of fun making
    the set and seeing how spooky or how festive I could make the
    individual masks. I think there is something here for everyone. Have
    fun!

    PS - The IconDropper <http://www.iconfactory.com/id_home.asp> pack
    of this collection contains special bonus icons that the set does
    not. This is my way of saying thanks to all of you who support our
    efforts by registering our software. Those of you using OS X can use
    the pack in conjunction with the factory's IconBrowser utility
    <http://www.iconfactory.com/ibr_home.asp>.

    *Work Notes*
    These icons were created using Macromedia Freehand, Adobe Photohop
    6.0 and IconBuilder Pro and are designed for use with OS 8.5 thru OS
    X. All icons lovingly crafted by hand.

    *Legality*
    The icons and images represented by these icon are Copyright ©2002
    The Iconfactory. The icons contained in this set are intended for
    personal desktop use ONLY. These icons MAY NOT BE REDISTRIBUTED,
    SOLD OR EXCHANGED FOR ANY GOODS OR SERVICES WHATSOEVER. In addition,
    the read-me file must accompany the set at all times. By downloading
    this file you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of use.

    *Icons in Mac OS X*
    The first thing you need to know is that getting information for a
    file or folder works a little differently than it does in Mac OS 9.
    In Mac OS 9 (and earlier), when you press Command-I, you get a Get
    Info window for each item you have selected in the Finder. With Mac
    OS X, there is no Get Info.

    Get Info has been replaced with an "Inspector". The inspector is
    shown or hidden when you press Command-I. It also behaves
    differently; every time you select something in the Finder, the
    inspector shows additional information about the item. The good news
    is that even though the Inspector works differently, it still allows
    you to change icons for most desktop items.

    Here is a step-by-step guide for setting a folder icon:
    1) Select a file or folder that has the icon you want to use.
    2) Press Command-I to bring up the Inspector panel.
    3) Click on the icon once. You should see a gray border around the
       icon (see figure.)
    4) Press Command-C to copy the icon. Do NOT close the inspector panel.
    5) Select the file or folder that you want to customize. Press
    Command-V to paste the icon.
       That's it!

    *Setting Classic Icons*
    The most common use of custom icons is as a replacement for the
    standard file and folder icons that are built into your Mac's
    operating system. Many people find that it is much easier to find a
    file that you are looking for by spotting a cool, colorful icon
    rather than by its name. Icons can be cut and pasted onto almost any
    item on the Macintosh. For the most part however, they are just a
    whole lot of fun. As for how to apply them, here is the most
    straight forward way:

    1. On your desktop, select the icon you would like to use
    2. Select "Get Info" (command-I) from the File Menu for that icon
    3. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window
    4. Choose "Copy" (command-C) from the Edit menu
    5. Close the window
    6. Select the file/folder you want to apply that icon to
    7. Select "Get Info" (File menu) for that icon
    8. Click on the icon in the upper left of the window
    9. Select "Paste" (command-V) from the Edit Menu.
       (this method won't work on the trash can)
    10. You're done!

    A tip of the hat goes out to artist Josh Agle
    <http://www.shag-art.com/> (a.k.a. Shag) for the sub-conscious
    inspiration to create this set. Shag's style and approach is just so
    darned cool, it makes me want spend the rest of my days hanging out
    in one of his retro Tiki lounges.

    Thanks also to Stuart Sandler for putting me onto Shag in the first
    place.

    More thanks go out to Jen over at PixelDecor
    <http://www.pixeldecor.com/> for her continued support of The
    Iconfactory and for making such groovy, retro patterns.

    And last, but certainly not least, thanks to Mindy for her continual
    support and feedback on my work. You are the best sweetie!
