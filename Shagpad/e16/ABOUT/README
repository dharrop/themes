--[about]

  This theme aims to be a nice-looking lightweight theme for Enlightenment.
For a gtk2 and/or evidence theme go to

  * http://www.morganleahrecords.com/shmindex.html

  For native X cursors cd to cursors/ and

		mv cursors.cfg{,-old}

  and

		cp cursors.cfg{-nativeX,}

--[cursors]

  I find when it's set to native cursors weird things happen.  Like I'll end up with a GIMP cursor for awhile.  YMMV.  Perhaps I'm not doing something right in the config.

--[font]

  You can easily change the font in the theme by going into the ttfonts directory and changing the symbolic link to a different font.  The link should be called myfont.ttf, unless you want to edit the config files too.

--[license]

  Everything in this theme is released under the GPL with the following exceptions.  Everything in the Fontilicious and Iconfactory directories are (C) by their respective creaters/owners.  Please see below for details on their license.

  Note: This theme has been built on top of the Aqua theme... and all the
Aqua-y bits are originally based on Aqua by Eric Yang and E-X by Ben
Frantzdale. 

  Michel Salim [mas69@cam.ac.uk] has removed all references to Apple.
                                                                                
  (Not much remains of the original theme.  Most bits have been replaced with the  exception of the title bar (although it has been slightly modified), epplets, sound, eterm (arrows))
