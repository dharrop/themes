Sensible for Enlightenment-16
<br>
<p>
<font face=-*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-* color=#000000>
Sensible is a small, clean, original and mature theme.  It is the theme that I use everyday.  Thank you for trying it.

Most recent changes:
<br>
<font face=-*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-* color=#000000>
<p>Added imageclasses for the iconbox.
<br>
<p>Dramatically simplified window borders.  Naming conventions of windows and borders is now much smarter.  Added some new cursors, too.
<br>
<p>Modified the mouse bindings a little.  Also added some desktop buttons and icons for terminals, editors and netscape-- I did not draw them, I don't know where I got them (they are the only non-original pieces of this theme.)

<p>I consider this theme complete, but am still willing to take and impliment suggestions. Let me know if you have any:
