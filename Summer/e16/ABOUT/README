--- ABOUT SUMMER THEME ---

Summer theme is based on Spring theme (my previous work),
originally based on Winter theme made by Rephorm ; without
his great work, Summer would probably not exist.


Summer was designed for Enlightenment 0.16.x (better 0.16.7+)
It was essentialy inspired and made to pursue the concept of
seasons introduced by Winter and followed by Spring.
 
Summer include all the new features and bugfixes provided by 
Spring theme but with a redesign for windows borders, buttons
and flashy, funny, sunny colors especially made to 'summerize'
and enlight a little more your desktop.

Quick FAQ


- How to install Summer E16 theme ?

First uncompress the tar.gz theme file with the tar -xzvf command,
after that, simply put the Summer directory obtained in your home
directory under ~/.enlightenment/themes


- The theme doesn't work for me, what can I do ?

Verify your version of Enlightenment : if you use an older version
(eg. before 0.16.5) the theme will probably not work correctly. So
if you're in this case update your Enlightenement version if you
want to use Summer.


- Can I use this theme under E17 ?

A quick answer : no. E17 theme engine is not the same as E16 and
work with a different theme format. For this reason all E16 themes
including Summer will NOT work with E17.


- Do you plane to port this theme under E17 ?

Hum that seems to be a good idea in the future ;-) I probably did
a port of Summer soon after official release of E17, because it
still misses a lot of features in his actual state of development.
Currently I'm focused on the realisation of another seasonal
fashioned theme (Autumn) for the last fans of E16 :-)
