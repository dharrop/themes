*** Guide for installing the dE-theme for Enlightenment 0.15.x / 0.16.x ***
***
There aren't really many things to do for a complete installation, some things
needs to be installed properly though for the best result.
***
1. The PCF-font.
---
I've added a nice looking font, which also is full ansi.
It's a font of the type PCF, which means you'll be able to use it in an rxvt or xterm for example.
If you haven't already got it, install it like this:
<prompt>cd fonts
<prompt>cp outcast.pcf /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc
<prompt>cd /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc
<prompt>mkfontdir
<prompt>xset fp rehash
Should be done. Try to start an rxvt with the parameter -fn outcast.

2. The icons.
---
As I hope you've noticed, I've placed three icons in the right lower corner.
One for terminals, one for networkingapplications and finally one for editors.
As you might know, the root-menu is individually, which means it doesn't change from one theme to another.
However, with icons this is not the case.
I've used my personal commands, which I am PRETTY sure you wanna edit.
Do it like this:
<prompt>xemacs actionclasses.cfg
- Use the search-option in the Edit-menu.
- Type 'IES'.
- You should now be at the section of the terminal-icon.
- You'll see the commands used, just change them all to your personal ones.
- Type 'IES' again at the search-option.
- You should be at the section of the networking-icon.
- Change the commands to your personal ones.
- Type 'IES' once more at the search-option.
- You should now be at the section of the editor-icon.
- Change the commands to your personal ones.
- Save the file and restart the theme.
It should now be fixed, your own commands are now used instead of mine.
