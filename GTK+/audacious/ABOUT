GTK+ for XMMS/WinAmp Skin
-------------------------
James M. Cape <jcape@jcinteractive.com>

This skin is designed to be a match for the Gimp ToolKit, a popular widget set on Unix/Linux, used in the GNOME Project <http://www.gnome.org>.

This skin is covered under the GNU General Public License. My only stipulation upon redesitribution and modification is that I be given authorial credits, and this document stays unmodified with the skin.
