Welcome to the Desert Vox, the newest theme by me :)
I did all the graphics, except the epplets...those I stole from another theme a while ago (minEguE2) and didn't change them because they are the best looking and easier to read epplets out there :)
Anyway, I hope you like it...any problems, let me know by email or catch me at #linuxhelp on Undernet
