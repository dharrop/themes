This theme used minEgue as the base. Thanks to Ben frantb-at-rpi-dot-edu 
for creating the minEgue theme. 

To do:

---< window_focus
---< panel actionclass // ibuttons.cfg
---< diff_window borders
---< code clean up
---< directory structure
---< perhaps add pcf fonts for Eterm

Bugs:

ROOT_WINDOW_MENU backhground select
