Industrial Theme ChangeLog
--------------------------

October 20, 1999 - Added more borders

Added a PAGER_LEFT and a PAGER_RIGHT border.
Also added SIDE border for the gimp. The
fixed size and transient borders are on
the way.

October 18, 1999 - Added Warning Background

Designed a background to go with the theme. It is
now used as the startus background.

October 10, 1999 - Started Writing Industrial

Took some images from the Industrial skin for WinAMP
and made some of my own. Currently supports DR16. 
The theme has full pager and iconbox support, has
a full set of widgets. The theme currently only has
a few border types. Transient, Fixed, and other
borders will come soon.
