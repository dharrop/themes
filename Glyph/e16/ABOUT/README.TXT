All images contained in this theme (except the very few pieces from
the origional cvs theme) are offered to the public domain. If you
wish, it would be froody to mention "Z0z" if you use any of these
images, but do not feel you need to. This is done in part because
of the complete stupidity of some people in the community about
intellectual property as it pertains to graphics. It is my
believe that images should be used and reused in perpitude.

Great works should stem from other great works. (None of which
you will probably find here)

Consume and Enjoy.

Z0z.
