Yeah, this is a new-ish theme for DR16, still haven't tried too hard to build DR17 themes, but whatever =D

Been working on this one at work during lunches and stuff, yes, i work for a company that allows me to use linux and E so i am one happy bunny!

The original version of this theme can be found on my deviant art page, but i prefer this one so you'll have to find that one on your own ;)

Hope you crazy kids enjoy the theme...
