         Ok, pika-Drew is on the case now.  I've got most things working, and i've
         got most things working.  The layout of the theme has changed also, I spent
         alot of time tweeking and getting rid of a lot of crap that was in here.
         I'm working on some more graphics for dialogs and a new pager border, this 
         theme is only 75% done.
         All other errors introduced by previous authors have been fixed, and theme
         layout eg, config locations, has been totally redone.
