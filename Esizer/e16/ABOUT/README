This theme was based entirly on the AmpSizer WinAmp skin, using modified
config files from both the "Clean" and "ShinyMetal" themes for
Enlightenment.

Here's the Readme from the skin:


- Ampesizer Standard 2
-
- a skin for WinAMP 2.0 or higher. Includes Playlist and EQ skins.
-
- version 1.0 - 22.01.99

The Ampesizer series are my favourite skins, and I found it really
strange that the Standard version didn't have a WinAMP 2.0 update.
So I got to work and I made the update, adding EQ and Playlist skins
and making other corrections.
Full credit to MATDesign for the original Ampesizer Standard skin, it
is really one of my favourites.
Enjoy!
