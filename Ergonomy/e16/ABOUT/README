            theme
                   for Enlightenment


(Try it with Ergonomy theme for gtk)

Created from several ideas about user interface, and adapted to the
Gnome (gtk+Enlightenment?) developing possibilities (and to my limited 
knowledge of them :). Originally based on Win95 theme, I've changed
many things.

Please feel free to modify and create new themes from it.

For any suggestion, idea, ... you'll find me at:
aferrer@dit.upm.es

Enjoy Linux!
