This is a hacked version of the eSlate for gkrellm theme
In this pack are included three fonts which needed to work this theme 
propperly those fonts are :
snap by artwiz
smooth by tigert (or i think so)
shine  by tigert (or i think so)
This theme looks cool with the original eSlate Etheme with my eSlate-hacked.n0l0g1k-E Etheme
and width eSlate gtk theme (i'm using it with my hacked.eslate and aqua gtk theme) 

Enjoy !
