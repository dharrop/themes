base 0.2

This is a base theme that I am working from to learn E.  If you
get this its because you wanted to use some lame-o "theme" from
OctobrX ;)

Hope you enjoy the "theme".

::: Updates :::

11 - 14 - 99 == Updated menus, they looked kinda wierd.  Seems
a bit better now.  Fixed close, min and max icons.  They sorta
sucked before.  Nuked sounds, I don't use them, and they were
adding to the size of the file.  Enjoy, and as always, Triple
your money back if you don't like it!
