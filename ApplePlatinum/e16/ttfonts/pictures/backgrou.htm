My first design is &quot;MartyBold&quot; which is my interpretation of a &quot;way loosenedup Garamond.&quot; This font is available for free from my <AHREF="http://www.scootergraphics.com/">web site</A>. My firstcommercially successful font is &quot;Nu Sans&quot; (formerlyknown as Epsy Sans), which is a design based on Apple Computer'sEspy Sans bitmap font. Nu Sans has gone through quite a few versions.As my skill improved, so did Nu Sans. Along the way, I designedmany other fonts. I am mostly interested in fonts that can beused for general text as well as headlines. In this way, I amstriving to crush the &quot;In the future, all fonts will be hardto read&quot; movement by offering interesting fonts that do notstrain the eyes. I have also created digital versions of fontsthat were only previously available as phototype.</P><P>I am currently back in school to earn my second Bachelor ofArts. My first B.A. is in Music with an Emphasis in Compositionfrom Whitworth College. Now I am working on a B.A. in GraphicDesign from Central Washington University. My goal is to eventuallywind up with a Masters in Graphic Design and begin a teachingcareer. Along the way I plan to work for a few ad agencies togain real-world experience in graphic design.</P><P>Scooter Graphics is my company. It's a one-man graphic/fontdesign business that's sole purpose is to put me through college.Scooter Graphics is available for logo design, web page creation,brochures, business cards, forms, flyers and custom font designsor modifications.</P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><TABLE CELLPADDING="0" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0"HEIGHT="48" WIDTH="434">  <TR>    <TD WIDTH="40"><A HREF="readme.htm"><IMG SRC="arrow.gif" BORDER="0"      WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="* "></A></TD>     <TD WIDTH="394"><B><A HREF="readme.htm">Documentation</A></B><BR>      Go back to the Documentation page</TD>  </TR> </TABLE></BODY></HTML>
