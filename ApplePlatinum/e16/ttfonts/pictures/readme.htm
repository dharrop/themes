Pfeiffer at Scooter Graphics.(<A HREF="backgrou.htm">background info</A>)<BR>Price: Free!</P><P>Virtue is my improvement of Apple Computer's &quot;Charcoal&quot;font appearing in Mac OS 8.</P><H1>About Virtue:</H1><P>There is a lot of controversy about Charcoal. Basically, alot of people did not want this font to appear in the Mac OS 8.A &quot;reverse-engineered&quot; font developed by Greg Landweberfor his Aaron extension and Kaleidoscope control panel gave peoplea first look at Charcoal. Greg built his font from looking atvarious screen shots and did a good job at making a very completefont. However, the spacing information and special characterscharacters seemed a little off to me. It seems that Apple couldn'tdecide whether Charcoal should have two pixels between the lettersor just one. This lead to a cramped appearance on screen.</P><P>So here's what I did: basically, I took his work and triedto space it how I would if I was making Apple's next font. I studiedthe &quot;Chicago&quot; system font and and used it as a templatefor my font. After about 2 hours of tinkering, I had a bitmapfont that looked really good as a replacement font for Kaleidoscope.About a week later, after tinkering some more, I made even moreimprovements.</P><P>Starting with version 3.0, Virtue is a TrueType-only font.There are no bitmaps, instead advanced TrueType instructing createsan excellent on-screen appearance. The techniques I used to accomplishthis will soon be applied to my other font creations.</P><H1>Virtue Patch Info:</H1><P>There are two patches included in this package. One is forMac OS 8.5.1 and the other is for Mac OS 8.1. Choose the one thatcorresponds to your system software (if you are unsure what versionof the Mac OS you are running, you can check it by selecting &quot;Aboutthe computer...&quot; from the &quot;Apple Menu&quot; in the &quot;Finder.&quot;)</P><P>The instructions for patching these system files are quitesimple.</P><OL>  <LI>Remove any previous version of Virtue from your Fonts folder  (located at System:Fonts).  <LI>Drag Virtue to your closed &quot;System&quot; folder.</OL><P>And that's it! To use Virtue, simply restart your computerand then open the &quot;Appearance&quot; control panel. Switchto the Virtue font (Hold down the option key if you are usingMac OS 8.1).</P><H1>Freeware Notice:</H1><P>You don't need to pay a cent for this font. In fact, I willrefuse to take any money for it at all. Please, I'm begging you,NO MONEY!!!!! If you want to spend some money, take a look atsome of my other fonts <A HREF="mpfonts.htm">previewed here</A>and buy them from my website. I do retain all rights to this font,so don't even think about trying to sell it. I mean really, howtacky could you get.</P><H1>Distribution Info:</H1><P>If you would like to include Virtue on a CD or upload it toyour favorite ftp site, please <A HREF="mailto:marty@scootergraphics.com">sendme a note</A>. I'm more than happy to allow Virtue to be distributedthrough different channels, I just want to be in the loop :-)Please see my <A HREF="eul.htm">End User License Agreement</A>for details about proper use of my fonts.</P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><TABLE CELLPADDING="0" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0"WIDTH="434" HEIGHT="144">  <TR ALIGN="TOP">    <TD WIDTH="40"><A HREF="https://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/r1.cgi?WM&"><IMG       SRC="register.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"      ALT="* "></A></TD>     <TD WIDTH="394"><B>Register Online </B>(<A HREF="https://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/r1.cgi?WM&">Secure</A>      | <A HREF="http://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/r1.cgi?WM&">Non-Secure</A>)<BR>      Register any Scooter Graphics font from your web browser</TD>   </TR>  <TR>    <TD WIDTH="40"><A HREF="http://www.scootergraphics.com/fontcomment.html"><IMG       SRC="form.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"      ALT="* "></A></TD>     <TD WIDTH="394"><B><A HREF="http://www.scootergraphics.com/fontcomment.html">Comments?</A></B><BR>      Send Marty a comment about his fonts.</TD>   </TR>  <TR ALIGN="TOP">    <TD WIDTH="40"><A HREF="mpfonts.htm"><IMG SRC="arrow.gif" BORDER="0"      ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="* " WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></A></TD>     <TD WIDTH="394"><B><A HREF="mpfonts.htm">Scooter Graphics Font      Samples</A></B><BR>      See samples all the fonts available from Scooter Graphics</TD>   </TR></TABLE><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3>Version History</H3><UL>  <LI>3.0--Got rid of the bitmaps!
