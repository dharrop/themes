This is the Brushed Metal theme for Enlightenment. This theme is the Default
theme shipped with Enlightenment and thus is maintained to the highest 
standards to ensure it supports all new features in Enlightenment.

The original artwork was done by Tigert (http://tigert.gimp.org/) and 
subsequent artwork, cleaning up, configuration files and maintenance are done
by The Rasterman (http://www.rasterman.com).

I hope you enjoy this theme, and that it meets your expectations of a good 
looking interface.
