Modified dialogs to use marble background instead of brass - this seems a
little more appropriate for a theme called "marble"

Merged my recent changes in with Steven Ponsford's directory restructuring.  Should be ready for release - let me know if you see anything amiss.

Additional Changes by Steven: new fonts, iconbox (his was a bit nicer than mine
:-), two additional backgrounds - Thanks Steven!

Also added Steven's gkrellm themes to the directory structure - if you haven't
checked this program out and you like gadgets, see http://web.wt.net/~billw/gkrellm/gkrellm.html - nice piece of software.

Anyone for a XMMS theme?
