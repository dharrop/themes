Special thanks out to Steven Ponsford (sponsfor@ix.netcom.com) for helping with
this release - He restructured the directories and added a few features to help
make it compliant with the Enlightenment 0.16 series.  Also included in this
release are two backgrounds furnished by Steven.  See the ChangeLog included
in the archive for additional information.

This theme was designed using Tigert's Brushed-Metal theme as a base and was
inspired by my Marble GTK theme.  As with the GTK theme, all images were
created in the GIMP.  Patterns were used for the Marble & wood, gradients were
used for the brass look.<br>
Feel free to send comments and suggestions to the address below.<br>
This theme is under the GPL.
