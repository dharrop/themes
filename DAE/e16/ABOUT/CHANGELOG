D.A.E. CHANGELOG

figured it was high time to add one of these so i can at least keep up with
what i have/haven't done ;)

27 April 2001

  Added CONCEPT and CONCEPT2. None of these border types are all that useful, 
  but think of the concept cars. (I did have CONCEPT 1 thru 5 but that was
  getting really silly :)

26 April 2001 

  sorted out that stupid bug i left in all the border.cfg files wrong link
  to wrong cursor type was RESIZE_TR (whatever the hell that is) is now 
  RESIZE_BL. As a punishment for my stupidity i made myself change all
  references from RESIZE_TR to RESIZE_BL by hand.

  changed the STYLE3 border coz it was actually a bit crap ;)

25 April 2001

  Made a few updates/changes to the ABOUT/MAIN, also figured that although
  most of us know what widgets are and how they work it just felt right to
  include them in the dox. Besides that it looks pretty too (isn't that why
  we use enlightenment?)

  Been tinkering with the windowmatches.cfg file this should mean that i can
  keep the DEFAULT border as a typical generic border type and use all the
  "flashy" border types for more important things like Eterms...

  /me loves Eterms

  Added CHANGELOG (bits from a cluttered memory ;) DAE.FAQ TODO and README.DAE
  Added 2 more border styles "MINIMAL" and "SHAPED"
  *note: i will now have to fill up the border menu again

     Current Border list stands at 21

        BORDERLESS
        BORDER_ONLY
        DEFAULT
        DEFAULT2
        FIXED_SIZE
        GIMP
        ICONBOX
        LEFT_SIDE
        LEFT_SIDE2
        MENU
        MENU_BORDER_ONLY
        MINIMAL
        PAGER
        PAGER_DOWN
        SHAPED
        STANDARD
        STYLE
        STYLE2
        STYLE3
        TOP
        TRANSIENT

24 April 2001

  Eterm theme hacking time. Managed to get a colour scheme going on :)
  now to work on the gfx.
  btw, if any one is actually interested here is the Eterm.cfg i have in
  my E user_apps.menu

  Eterm -O -F -lfp-smooth-medium-r-normal-*-*-90-*-*--*-iso8859-1
  --cmod 160 --scrollbar 0

23 APRIL 2001

  Added a base image for the icons in the icon box, Thanks again to Nate Godin.
  Started hacking at gtk themes for some ideas. Decided for final that the
  Xenophilia engine IS the way to go (pixmap engine and my measly 400Mhz CPU
  with it's paltry 64MB ram does not work well). It does mean the gfx will be
  less pretty but Xenophilia supports gradients on the fly (this is good).
  

20 April 2001

  Ripped cursor ideas from various themes and changed the cursor colours
  to match DAE a bit more, thanks to Nate Godin for that one :) Also changed
  the DEFAULT border to what was the TRANSIENT border due to Gimp & E clashes
  and crashes.

  epplet, iconbox and dialog gfx now all tie in with the theme.


01 April 2001 to 20 April 2001

   Some stuff happened but i'm buggered if i can remember what ;)
   
   I still have some of the origional D.A.E. gfx designes and i'm so glad
   i waited 'till i released it ;)
