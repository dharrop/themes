1.0 About D.A.E.

    The whole concept behind this project is a cool, blue, digital and dark. I 
    just wanted a theme that screams "Hey! i'm running Enlightenment"...
    
    As time progresses i will add gtk, XMMS and gkrellm themes.

2.0 Theme Features

    I hope to have all possible enlightenment features implemented at some 
    point and i will continue with this theme through E-17 onwards.

    The current feature list consists of highlighted & clicked 
    widgets and a different set of widgets/headers for "stuck"
    windows.
    
    There are also a vast amount of border styles for practically all of your 
    border needs (21 so far).
    
    As if this was not enough there's also a button launcher for all your 
    favourite apps. (well, hopefully by the next revision ;)


3.0 Theme Customization

    Blah and bah, i will sort this out soon ;)

    Linus Torvalds: (duh). 
    The GNU people: We have the tools thanks to your talent ;) 
    Mandrake & Rasterman: Enlightenment rocks and i thank you for it. 
    h0ax||: bluehEart is a beuty. 
    frantzdb: minEguE was the first theme i hacked appart and without that 
                     D.A.E. would have probably been a Window Maker theme.

    Special thanks to Nate Godin for the bits i missed :) 

    Extra special thanks to Anna He for an endless list of great things =)
