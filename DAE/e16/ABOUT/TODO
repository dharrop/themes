There are also a few sketchy areas on some of the borders that need
cleaning up.

The docs could do with being finished and i really need to get round
to adding a button bar (disabled by default)

Couple of unsupported classes need widgets and things too and i also
need to dream up some new border styles and stuff ;)

SOUNDS!! they won't be included in the actual .etheme i will house them
on my website, but i think sounds are a darn fine idea.

That bloody init, but i hardly ever see it so it seems to be stagnant.
