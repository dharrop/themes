Theme scheme time! You can use the spiffomatic.pl script to modify colors for
spiffE. It's very cool. If you'd like the default colors back, just hit enter
when prompted for a value.

* Added spiffomatic.pl
* Added template images
* Modified theme config files slightly

------------------ 

Everything has been updated.

* There are now 21 borderstyles.
* The epplets have gotten an overhaul.
* There is a new maximize button at Trae "OctobrX" McCombs' request
* The other buttons got tweaked also.
* New borders for pagers, iconbox, etc.
* Iconbox minimizing issue resolved (thanks Ian Crawford for the motivation!)
* Titlebar fonts are *not* TTF now -- more speed and crisper rendering.
* Menus restyled, including new image menu.
* The computer speech wavs (pref sounds) have been removed, slicing the 
	size of the theme in half!
* Titlebar / winops menus now have the ability to shade.
* Border_only window style added, as it can be useful.
* Two new backgrounds -- older are kept as well (they are only a few bytes)
* Misc fixes and speedups based on time spent w/ Raster & Mandrake 
	(in person and on irc)
* Dragbar becomes 12 pixels when you remove your settings 
	(remove your ...e_session-XXXXXX ...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 in
	 ~/.enlightenment/ for this)
* Did I mention that epplets got an overhaul?
* Whole bunch of other stuff as well.

Thanks go out to Moss from Themes.org for constantly pestering me to release
a new version of spiffE, as well as being my most active beta tester. *g*

In addition, I would also like to thank both Carsten and Geoff for putting
up with my random pesterings.

Also, I'd like to thank the users of this theme. *g*
