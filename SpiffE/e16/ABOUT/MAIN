I made this theme since I wanted a fast, clean, small, good looking, 
and original theme for Enlightenment.

<p>
As most themes, this is a work in progress. I hope to further refine it in the
future according to your suggestions and ideas.

It's useful to note that the right mouse button performs a handy window shading
feature. Essentially, I have swapped the right and middle mouse buttons to
facilitate rolling up windows on a two button input device (such as my laptop),
but I have found that it works quite well on a three button trackball as well.

If you dislike this feature (you should at least try it out first) and want to
get the defaults back, rename the actionclasses.cfg in this theme's directory,
purge the config cache, restart, and you should be happy.

I have put a lot of work into this theme (making it 0.16.x compliant as well),
and I hope you enjoy it!
