spiffMEDIA v1.0
---------------
by Garrett LeSage <garrett@linuxart.com>

Made to match my other spiff* themes. You can find them all on
http://themes.org/

(as of this time, spiffE, spiffMILL, spiffGTK, and others... at least 
around one per subsite! *g*)

And, of course: 
All graphics done in the Gimp (http://gimp.org/)... what else? *g*
