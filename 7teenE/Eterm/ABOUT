Eterm 0.9.2 BlueBrushedMetal Theme
----------------------------------

This theme provides a nice purpley-blue Eterm theme which looks good with
the BrushedMetal enlightenment theme and is an alternative to the
green-blue of its Eterm theme.

Like all other flea.org releases, this theme is released under the terms of
the GNU General Public Licence, obtainable at
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html.

Installation
------------

1. In ~/.Eterm/themes/ or /usr/share/Eterm/themes/ (or wherever else you
store your Eterm themes) run the following command: 

	tar zxvf BlueBrushedMetal-Eterm-theme.tar.gz

2. To run Eterms with this theme run the following command:

	Eterm -t BlueBrushedMetal

Custom Configuration
--------------------

The default theme has the same font and window size settings as the
original BrushedMetal Eterm theme.  

To set your personal requirements put a file called user.cfg in
~/.Eterm/themes/BlueBrushedMetal/ with settings as required.  See any
theme.cfg file to view the manny settings that can be changed.

Mine looks like this, the main effect of which is to give me smaller
windows and a funkier font (Raster's nexus font):

<Eterm-0.9.2>
 begin attributes
     geometry 80x24
     font 2 nexus
 begin toggles
   visual_bell on
 end toggles
