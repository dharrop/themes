Time to Re-theme Everything
<font face=aircut3/10 color=#000000>
<p>
Thanks for using Absolute E, the theme that thinks diffrently.
This theme is created by Hallvar Helleseth using nothing but
The Gimp.  Everything is originaly made by me - Propably the only
Etheme that can say that ;) Though alot of people have helped me
(too many to list here/can't remeber all of them either...) But
I give them a BIG thank you!
<br>
There is also a WindowMaker version of this theme, look for that on
wm.themes.org.
<br>
This theme is going to be following the cvs version of E and not the
stable version (DR0.15.5)
