The theme itself was inspired by the big Le_Mans race, you can see a picture of the winner on the previous page.</p><br>

As you have noticed, it isn't just Shiny_Metal with a new suit on, or another OS lookalike,  and that is the way I like it.  Though it may look a little confusing, once you settle in with it the theme is fairly intuitive.  Well, we are almost finished here!  I hope you enjoy it, and happy Enlightening.<br>

<p align=50%>Well, thanks for taking an interest in who I am!<br><br>
I am currently a Junior at the Ohio State University studying Computer Science Engineering.  I love linux becuase it gives me CHOICE, and that is why I love E.  I also like the culture of linux and the idea that quality software can come from people who want to code, not just people chasing after green.<br><br>
I love cars, and that is why I made this theme.  I also wanted to come up with something original.  The themeing itself was quite an experience.  I did it in between my spring and summer quarters, and it took quite a while.<br><br>
I would love to hear what you think of the theme.  Also, if you are themeing and need some help, I might be able to help.  I can be contacted at zosima@geocities.com.  Thanks.</p>
