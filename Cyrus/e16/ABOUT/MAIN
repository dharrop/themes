	I started to create the Cyrus Theme during some days I had a flu
	in January 1999.
        It should give a professional but dark look and feel to Enlightenment and 
        is supposed to be nice in behavior as well as in appearance. <br>
        From month to month it got darker and weirder to meet my very personal 
        opinion of aesthetics.
</p>
<p align=50%>
	Some well-designed themes emulate the look of other OS, 
	but through the years Linux developed into a powerful OS which 
	does not need to hide. 
</p>
<p align=50%>
	Thanks to all the people who inspired and encouraged me, and of course to all those
	who use this theme.

I am running Linux since kernel 1.1.20, that was about four years ago.<br>
It was the time I sold my Amiga to buy a PC. I made my first expriences with 
M$ Windows 3.11 and I hated it from the first moment;
looking for alternatives I found Linux.
<br> 
While studying computer science at Dortmund University I got skilled in programming 
BETA and C/C++, and Linux was the platform fitting my needs best.<br>
With Enlightenment/GNOME I got a functional and good-looking environment.
