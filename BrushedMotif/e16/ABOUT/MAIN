BrushedMotif is a theme for the Enlightenment window manager.  It uses the
texture from the BrushedMetal theme with a slate tint to emulate the look and
feel of Motif (MWM).  The interface is easy to navigate and it is very clean
and not as graphically intense as many other Enlightenment themes.  Perfect
for those who like a clean professional look, but a bit more graphical, rather
than the same flat boring colors day-in and day-out.

Epplet textures and configuration were taken from the BrushedMetal theme, with
slight modifications.  All credit is due to Tigert and Raster.

I hope this theme works for you, and feel free to change anything you would
like.  I created this theme for fun, and there's something about Motif's look
that I can't seem to shake.  You may contact me at cocidius@telebot.net via
Email if you would like to comment upon this theme, ask questions, or just
bitch about and flame me for such an un-original looking theme.  Whatever the
reasons be, feel free to do as you will.
