Well here it is...a port of Obsidian to DR0.15 CVS.
It's not even close to being finished, but the buttons, window borders are
done, and the root menus and icons are close enough.  I know it ain't perfect,
but who cares.  Hack it up and make it work the way you want to :) Right now
internally its a mess...someone else can clean that up, my work is done :P
