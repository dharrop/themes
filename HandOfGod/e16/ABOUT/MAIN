This theme was orginally created for E 0.15 by Technoir. However, when E 0.16 
came out. The theming structure have changed and this theme died along with the
E 0.15..
<p>
With a bit of power and magic, Hand Of God has been picked up and a new spell
cast for it to be alive and kicking into E 0.16 and definitely E17 when
available. This *was* the theme that gave Enlightenment the look. I hope this
theme gives back that feeling :)
<p>
You should be able to understand what those groovy buttons do on the side of
the theme ;)
<p>
Any suggestions, questions etc about this theme. Email me!
