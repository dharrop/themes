Welcome at the Dark-prp -(purple)- E theme...
This is a simple theme wich basicly made for personal use But i thought that it would be nice to share it with the other ppl.
It goes nice with eSlate gtk+ theme or any dark theme that you like...
If you are running gkrellm there is always the dark-prp.gkrellm theme by me:)
and the HeliX-Sweetpill (Eggplant alternative -4-) by me:) you can get it from
muhri.net or from my site ...<br>
Any improved version of the theme is always welcome at n0l0G1k@sdf.lonestar.org
