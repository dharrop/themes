This is tubular, the first ever truly hostile theme. No tooltips, no title bars - only the stuff you need to barely survive. I made it for myself after having got bored with things that get in the way.  I encourage you NOT to use this one if you're not a cyborg or at least a serious loony bin candidate. But seriously folks (?), I have tried to do just about everything in a nonconformist way (including the gfx) to exercise my brain. Oh, and thanks go to every theme author whose work I have shamelessly ripped.
