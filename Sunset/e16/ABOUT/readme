The Skins for gqmpeg and licq can be found within this tarball under the directory 
skins.

gqmpeg = dock-64x64-sunset and is an edited version of osk-dock-64x64-gray
licq = skin.hot and is an edited version of skin.cold.

Sunset is edited version of Razor.

This is my first e-theme.

Thanks to the creators of Razor skin.cold and osk-dock-64x64-gray.

There will be more from me in the future.
